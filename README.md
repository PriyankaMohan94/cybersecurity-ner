# SecureBERT-NER Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the SecureBERT-NER model from the CyberPeace Institute. The model is used to extract named entities from security advisory texts.

## Description

The SecureBERT-NER model is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model specifically trained for cybersecurity texts. It can identify various entities such as identities, security teams, tools, times, and attacks.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have the `transformers` library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers


## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the code:

```bash
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the pipeline with the pre-trained model
nlp = pipeline('ner', model='CyberPeace-Institute/SecureBERT-NER')

# Use the pipeline to extract entities from the text
entities = nlp(text)

For more detailed usage, please refer to the example provided in the repository.
